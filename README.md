# Push_swap 🥞

## Overview

The Push_swap project is a coding challenge at 42 that focuses on algorithm optimization and stack manipulation. The goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations while minimizing the number of operations performed. 🎯

## Objectives

- Implement a sorting algorithm using only two stacks. 📊
- Optimize the algorithm to minimize the number of operations. ⚙️
- Use a set of predefined operations to manipulate the stacks. 🔧

## Operations

The following operations are allowed:

- `sa`: Swap the first two elements of stack A. 🔄
- `sb`: Swap the first two elements of stack B. 🔄
- `ss`: Swap the first two elements of both stacks A and B. 🔄🔄
- `pa`: Push the top element of stack B to stack A. ⬆️
- `pb`: Push the top element of stack A to stack B. ⬇️
- `ra`: Rotate stack A upwards, shifting all elements up by one. 🔁
- `rb`: Rotate stack B upwards, shifting all elements up by one. 🔁
- `rr`: Rotate both stacks A and B upwards. 🔁🔁
- `rra`: Reverse rotate stack A downwards. 🔙
- `rrb`: Reverse rotate stack B downwards. 🔙
- `rrr`: Reverse rotate both stacks A and B downwards. 🔙🔙

## Installation

To get started with the Push_swap project, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HoudaChairi/42_push_swap.git
